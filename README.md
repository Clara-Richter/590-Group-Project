Horse racing is one of the oldest sports, where spectators watch highly trained horses race across large fields and put money down on a horse of their choice. This betting is a core element of the sport and, if their horse wins the race, they receive a portion of all the money bet in the race. Given the monetary incentives, sports betting is highly studied as excited gamblers try to figure out how to select a winning horse. Thus, the goal of this analysis is to determine what factors contribute to a horse winning or not and assess if it is possible to predict if a horse will win. This research is in direct response to the Big Data Derby 2022 Kaggle competition that intends to help owners, trainers, and veterinarians improve equine welfare and assess competition strategy. Specifically, we hone in on competition strategy and explore if horse finish position, horse odds, and race purse can be predicted and what factors are most influential. We also assess if neural networks or traditional machine learning models are more effective. 

The core data source of this project is the Big Data Derby 2022 Kaggle competition. It contains detailed information about horses and jockeys, results and monetary prizes, as well as the geographic coordinates of the horse in a race. This data was supplemented with text data of comments on each participating horseâ€™s performance during each race. This was obtained by scraping the race history statistics pdf files from EQUIBASE. External weather data was also added to examine the impact of various weather conditions on horse performance. Using the Visual Crossing Global Weather API, historical weather data like precipitation, temperature, humidity, cloudcover, and snow for each race location/timestamp was collected.  

The data could not be hosted in the repository due to its magnitude. Please refer to the shared Google drive for data and colab notebooks: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALCmvIZc4E4KUk9PVA
